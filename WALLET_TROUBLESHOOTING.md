# Wallet Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## Phantom Wallet Connection Issues

If you're having trouble connecting your Phantom wallet to the Builders Mansion app, follow these steps:

### 1. Check Environment Variables

Make sure you have the required environment variables set up in your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=your_privy_app_id_here
TAPESTRY_API_KEY=your_tapestry_api_key_here
```

**To get a Privy App ID:**
1. Go to [Privy Console](https://console.privy.io/)
2. Create a new app or use an existing one
3. Copy the App ID from your dashboard
4. Add it to your `.env.local` file

### 2. Phantom Wallet Setup

**Make sure Phantom is properly installed:**
1. Install Phantom from [phantom.app](https://phantom.app/)
2. Create or import a wallet
3. Make sure you're on the Solana network
4. Ensure you have some SOL for transactions

**Check Phantom settings:**
1. Open Phantom extension
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Developer Settings
3. Make sure "Allow all sites to connect" is enabled (for development)
4. Or add `localhost:3000` to the allowed sites list

### 3. Reconnection Issues After Disconnect

**If you can't reconnect after disconnecting:**

1. **Use the Debug Tool** (New Feature):
   - Look for the bug icon (üêõ) in the bottom-right corner
   - Click it to open the connection debug panel
   - Check the status of "Ready" and "Authenticated"
   - Copy the debug info if you need help

2. **Force Page Refresh**:
   - The app now automatically refreshes after disconnect
   - If that doesn't work, manually refresh the page (Ctrl+R / Cmd+R)

3. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Right-click the refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

4. **Check Phantom Extension**:
   - Make sure Phantom is unlocked
   - Try disconnecting from Phantom's side:
     - Open Phantom extension
     - Go to Settings ‚Üí Trusted Apps
     - Remove the localhost entry
     - Try connecting again

5. **Restart Development Server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
   pnpm dev
   ```

6. **Check Console for Errors**:
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for any error messages
   - The app now logs connection attempts

### 4. Browser Issues

**Clear browser cache and cookies:**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

**Check browser console for errors:**
1. Open developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any red error messages
4. Common errors and solutions:
   - `Privy not initialized`: Check your `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID`
   - `Wallet not found`: Make sure Phantom is installed
   - `Network error`: Check your internet connection

### 5. Network Issues

**Make sure you're on the right network:**
1. In Phantom, check the network selector
2. For development, use "Devnet" or "Mainnet"
3. Make sure you have SOL in your wallet

### 6. Connection State Issues

**Fixed Issues:**
- ‚úÖ **Duplicate Phantom wallets**: Now configured for Solana-only to prevent duplicates
- ‚úÖ **Wallet not showing when connected**: Now shows wallet address even without profile
- ‚úÖ **Poor disconnect flow**: Improved logout handling with proper state management
- ‚úÖ **Reconnection issues**: Added automatic page refresh and better error handling

**New Features:**
- **Wallet Status Indicator**: Shows connection state clearly
- **Better Dropdown**: Shows wallet info and profile status separately
- **Improved Disconnect**: Clean logout with proper state reset

### 7. Alternative Solutions

**Try different browsers:**
- Chrome (recommended)

### 8. Development Server

**Restart the development server:**

# Then restart
pnpm dev
```

**Check if the server is running properly:**
1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. You should see the Builders Mansion homepage
3. The "Connect Wallet" button should be visible in the header

### 9. Common Error Messages
